JSE :- Standard edition gives the basic knowledge of java and also some high 
        level classes like database accessing, network, security GUI is there.

        on server i.e web application.

JDK/ JRE/ JVM

JVM :- Runs the precompiled java programs.
        it contains
            interpreter
            Garbage collector.

Difference in JVM compiler and JVM interpreter
JVM compiler converts the source code to byte code and
interpreter lives inside the JVM that converts the bytecode to machine understandable
code.

JRE :- Java runtime enviroment.
As by name it contains everything required to run a java file i.e
java class/ pakages /libraries and also JVM resides inside the JRE.

So the JVM, while running the java program used the classes and libraries 
supplied by JRE.
If we don't want to write a programm and just wanted to run it then we only
need JRE.

JDK :- Java development kit as by name it contains everything require to make
a java program i.e it contains JRE, set of libraries, compiler , JAR and additional
files need to write the java program.
