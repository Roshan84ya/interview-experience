what is bytecode?

** bytecode is OOPS code that runs on virtual machine rather than CPU and then
the VM converts that code to machine understandable language so that 
CPU can run that and produce the output.
**Bytecode is platform independent.
it is the reponsibility of the JVM to convert the bytecode acc. to machine


it is also called as portable code or (p-code)

Is JVM platform dependent ?
Yes, because it takes the java byte code and convert it to current
OS. So java software is platform dependent and java language is plaform
independent.

JVM is kind of middle ware between the OS and java language.JVM provides 
the enviroment to run the java file (class file) so at the end it depends 
upon the kernal and kernal is different for all the OS.

JAVA is secure why..
It does not uses pointer explicitly.
All programs in java runs in specific area called sanbox, this sanbox uses
bytecode verification process to ensure that the code loaded does not voilate
java security constraints.


Mutithreading :- when we can execute multiple parts or multiple function of
same programs simmultaneously then it is called multithreading.
this helps in proper utilization of CPU
multitsking:- when we execute different programm then it is multitasking.

ex:- if i'm using music player (consider it as a one program)
and at the same time i'm indreasing volume, searching for another song,
making any song my favourite adding other songs in queue. this all things are
done in single program so that is multithreading. But if we will be using
music player and power point then it is called multitasking.

Mutithreading only single process is allowed having multiple threads that can 
run simmultaneously.
multitsking multiple process runs with shared resources.
