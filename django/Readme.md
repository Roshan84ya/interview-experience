## Here we will start with Django

## Installation 

#### open you cmd type 
    pip install django
### after installation for version check and aslo check if the admin command 
    version -- python -m django version 
    admin   -- django-admin

### To start a project type we will use a django utility command i.e
    django-admin startproject project_name ** This commnad make most of the files that we require for a project

By running the above command we will get all the neccessary file created by django itself and also you can check 
by running the command
    python manage.py runserver (this will your first project with a default page of django)
## Congratulation !!

Now we will be making an file inside the mysite with names view.py
it will store all the info that we will be going to show on our website

the urls.py is used for basically linking the view/webpages
